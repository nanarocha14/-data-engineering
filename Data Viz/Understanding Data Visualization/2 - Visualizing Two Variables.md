## Line plots

### When should you use a line plot

- There are two continuous variables
- The question is about the relationship between the two variables
- Consecutive observations are connected somehow

Usually, but not always, the x-axis is dates or times.

Can be used for:

- Comparing multiple lines
- trend lines
- trend lines + log scale

The time x-axis doesn't always imply line plot
